        Project Summary: Individual Computational Analysis of ultrasound data in common carotid artery using MATLAB

        I worked at [Professor Xiao Yun Xu](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/yun.xu)'s laboratory at the Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London as a summer placement student. I was also very lucky to be one of the recipients of the Faculty of Engineering UROP Award, which has sponsored my placement. It was an immensely humbling experience as it was my first ever experience in carrying out an individual research project. I was also very fortunate to be able to collaborate and receive support from academics in University of Florence and Imperial College London. It helped me to understand the importance of problem-solving in a logical and quantitative manner while maintaining optimism when there were obstacles.
          - Aim of project: to determine changes in blood rheological properties and blood flow conditions with age in healthy volunteers using data acquired as part of a 12-year follow-up study
          - Using MATLAB to analyse ultrasound images to extract data on carotid vessel diameter, wall thickness, blood flow velocity and flow rate
          - Worked with medical researcher from University of Catanzaro, Italy to understand clinical context of the computational work

      details: |
        I was actively involved in hosting activities and events in ICPASS as a fresher, therefore I ran for the vice-president position in order to contribute to the community while gaining leadership experience.
        This experience not only made me lifelong friends, but also gave me many opportunities to network with students across the UK and build a professional relationship with the Imperial College Alumni Association Hong Kong (ICAAHK).
        I am most proud that I was one of the founders of the Mentorship Programme that aims to bridge the relationship between current students and Imperial alumni in Hong Kong. This helps the students to start building their professional network early and foster communication between the two groups.
        My responsibilities during the term included:
        - Hosted events that raise public awareness among students, including regular discussions on global issues, presentations on current affairs and formal parliament-style debates
        - Founder and coordinator of ICPASS & ICAAHK Mentorship Programme
          - Aim of programme: to bridge the relationship between current students and Imperial alumni in Hong Kong. Students would have the opportunity to arrange one-to-one sessions with alumni to seek advice on careers and personal development
          - Achieved participation of more than 50 students and the network grows larger over the years
        - Liaised with similar societies of other universities across the UK
